## 🎯 What is AliceMultiverse?

AliceMultiverse is transitioning from a command-line tool to an AI-native service. It enables AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT to help you organize media, manage creative projects, and automate workflows through natural conversation.

> **🚀 New**: Direct integration with Claude Desktop via MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## 🤖 AI-First Usage (Recommended)

### Claude Desktop Integration

1. **Install AliceMultiverse**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "alice": {
         "command": "alice",
         "args": ["mcp-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start chatting with Claude**:
   ```
   You: "Hi Claude, I need help organizing my AI-generated images"
   Claude: "I'll help you organize your AI-generated images using Alice..."
   
   You: "Check the quality of images in my Downloads folder"
   Claude: "I'll assess the quality of images in your Downloads folder..."
   ```

### What Can You Ask?

- "Organize my AI-generated images by quality and source"
- "Find all my cyberpunk-style portraits from last week"
- "Show me statistics about my creative projects"
- "Tag these images as references for my new project"
- "Find similar images to this one"

## 🔧 Debug CLI (Developers Only)

⚠️ **Direct CLI usage is deprecated.** The CLI is maintained only for debugging purposes.

```bash
# Debugging examples
alice --debug --dry-run              # Debug organization logic
alice --debug --check-deps           # Check dependencies
alice keys setup                     # Still available for API key setup
alice mcp-server                     # Start MCP server
```

For normal usage, please use Alice through AI assistants as shown above.

## ✨ Key Features

### Media Organization
- **🤖 AI Detection**: Recognizes content from 15+ AI tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- **⭐ Quality Assessment**: Multi-stage pipeline with BRISQUE, SightEngine, and Claude
- **📁 Smart Organization**: Automatically sorts by date, project, source, and quality
- **🏷️ Semantic Tagging**: Tag assets by style, mood, subject for easy discovery

### Creative Workflows
- **📊 Project Management**: Track assets across multiple projects
- **🔍 Smart Search**: Find assets using natural descriptions
- **🔄 Event Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into all operations
- **🎨 Style Analysis**: Understand and categorize your creative outputs

## 📋 Configuration

Create `settings.yaml` for persistent settings:
```yaml
paths:
  inbox: ~/Downloads/AI-Images
  organized: ~/Pictures/AI-Organized

processing:
  quality: true        # Enable quality assessment
  watch: false         # Enable watch mode

pipeline:
  default_mode: standard  # basic, standard, premium
```

### API Keys

For advanced features, configure API keys:
```bash
alice keys setup
```

This will guide you through setting up:
- **SightEngine**: Technical quality assessment
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: AI-powered defect detection

## 🏗️ Architecture

AliceMultiverse uses an event-driven architecture designed for AI orchestration:

- **Structured APIs**: AI translates natural language to precise operations
- **Event System**: Monitor long-running operations in real-time
- **Service Boundaries**: Clean separation for reliable AI control
- **Persistent State**: Maintains context between conversations

## 🎓 Examples

### AI Assistant Conversation
```
You: "I just generated 50 new images with Midjourney, can you help organize them?"

Claude: "I'll help organize your Midjourney images. Let me check your Downloads folder 
and organize them by quality. I'll use the premium pipeline to ensure accurate 
quality assessment..."

[Alice organizes images into dated folders with quality ratings]

Claude: "I've organized 50 images from your Downloads folder:
- 12 images rated 5-star (excellent quality)
- 23 images rated 4-star (good quality)  
- 15 images rated 3-star (average quality)

They're now in Pictures/AI-Organized/2024-03-15/midjourney/
Would you like me to show you the best ones?"
```

### Debugging
```bash
# For developers only
alice --debug --dry-run --verbose
```

## 🔮 Roadmap

AliceMultiverse is evolving into a comprehensive creative workflow orchestrator:

1. **Current**: Media organization with quality assessment
2. **Phase 1**: Full AI-native interface (in progress)
3. **Phase 2**: Multi-agent creative workflows
4. **Phase 3**: Integration with creative tools (ComfyUI, Photoshop, etc.)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed plans.
