# Test Coverage Report
Generated: January 17, 2025

## Current Test Suite Status

### Issues Identified

1. **Import Errors**: Many tests have outdated imports
   - Tests import removed functions like `get_workflow`, `list_workflows`, `get_registry`
   - These were removed during refactoring but tests weren't updated

2. **Dependency Issues**: 
   - OpenCV (cv2) has a version conflict causing AttributeError
   - This blocks the test runner from even starting

3. **Test Organization**:
   - 593 tests collected but 35+ have errors
   - Tests are split between unit/, integration/, and validation/

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests
- Located in: `tests/unit/`
- Status: Many import errors need fixing
- Key modules needing test updates:
  - test_workflows.py (imports removed registry functions)
  - test_providers.py (imports removed get_registry)
  - test_metadata_cache.py (likely outdated)

#### Integration Tests  
- Located in: `tests/integration/`
- Status: Similar import issues
- Tests real API integrations (when API keys available)

#### Validation Tests
- Located in: `tests/validation/`
- Purpose: Validate export formats (CapCut, DaVinci Resolve)
- Status: Unknown due to import issues

### Recommendations

1. **Fix OpenCV Issue**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall opencv-python opencv-python-headless
   pip install opencv-python==4.8.1.78
   ```

2. **Update Test Imports**:
   - Remove references to deleted functions
   - Update to use new modular structure
   - Example: Instead of importing from large modules, import from specific components

3. **Create New Tests for Refactored Modules**:
   - alice_structured → 8 new modules need tests
   - alice_interface → 9 new modules need tests  
   - media_organizer → 9 new modules need tests
   - timeline_preview → 6 new modules need tests
   - video_creation → 8 new modules need tests
   - validation → 4 new modules need tests

4. **Test Coverage Goals**:
   - Target: 80% coverage for core modules
   - Priority modules:
     - Core business logic (organization, search, understanding)
     - MCP tools (106 tools need testing)
     - New refactored components

### Next Steps

1. Fix immediate blockers (OpenCV, imports)
2. Update existing tests to match new structure
3. Write tests for new modular components
4. Set up CI/CD to prevent future test rot

## Note

The test suite needs significant updates to match the refactored codebase. This is expected after major refactoring but should be addressed to ensure code quality going forward.
