# AliceMultiverse Roadmap - Personal Development Plan

## Vision

AliceMultiverse is my personal creative workflow orchestrator that I access through natural conversation with Claude. Built for my specific needs: managing thousands of AI-generated images, finding specific content through semantic search, and preparing assets for video creation. This is a tool by me, for me - though others are welcome to fork and adapt it.

## Critical Questions (Re-evaluate Daily)

1. **Is this solving MY problems?** 
   - Finding specific images in my collection ‚úì
   - Natural language search through Claude ‚úì 
   - Tracking creative decisions ‚úì
   - Managing API costs ‚úì (cost warnings + CLI tools)
2. **Is the architecture still simple?** 
   - File-first approach ‚úì
   - AI-native interface ‚úì
   - DuckDB for search ‚úì
   - Redis optional ‚úì (file-based events by default)
3. **What am I spending money on?** 
   - Understanding API calls tracked ‚úì
   - Cost warnings before operations ‚úì
   - Budget limits enforced ‚úì
   - `alice cost report` for visibility ‚úì
4. **What's broken RIGHT NOW?** 
   - Documentation implies this is a product (needs update) ‚úÖ (fixed)
   - No --understand CLI flag (uses config only) ‚úÖ (fixed)
   - First-run experience could be smoother ‚úÖ (improved)
   - Repository needs cleanup (duplicate files, old code, media in git)

## üßπ Repository Cleanup Plan (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Why This Matters
The repo has accumulated cruft during rapid development. A clean repo = easier maintenance, faster AI context loading, and clearer for anyone (including future me) to understand.

### Phase 1: Immediate Cleanup (Do First)
- [ ] **Fix .gitignore**
  - [ ] Add: `*.egg-info/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`
  - [ ] Add: `inbox/`, `organized/`, `output/`, `training/` (except READMEs)
  - [ ] Add: `*.log`, `data/*.duckdb` (user-specific)
  - [ ] Remove tracked files that should be ignored
- [ ] **Remove media files from git**
  - [ ] Delete all images/videos in inbox/, organized/, output/, training/
  - [ ] Add placeholder READMEs explaining these directories
- [ ] **Commit current changes**
  - [ ] main_cli.py (--understand flag addition)
  - [ ] first_run.py (improved setup wizard)

### Phase 2: Code Cleanup
- [ ] **Remove deprecated interface files**
  - [ ] Verify alice_structured.py is the current API
  - [ ] Remove alice_interface.py, alice_interface_v2.py
  - [ ] Consolidate cli_handler.py and cli_handler_structured.py
- [ ] **Clean up migration files**
  - [ ] Remove PostgreSQL event migration code
  - [ ] Move completed migrations to legacy/ folder
  - [ ] Update docs to reflect current architecture
- [ ] **Consolidate storage modules**
  - [ ] Review overlapping functionality in storage modules
  - [ ] Merge or remove redundant code
  - [ ] Update imports and tests

### Phase 3: Documentation Cleanup
- [ ] **Consolidate settings examples**
  - [ ] Merge settings.yaml.example and settings.yaml.multipath.example
  - [ ] Create one comprehensive example with all options
- [ ] **Remove temporary docs**
  - [ ] Integrate README_STORAGE.md into main docs
  - [ ] Complete and remove REDIS_REMOVAL_PLAN.md
  - [ ] Update all Redis references to show it's optional
- [ ] **Update stale documentation**
  - [ ] Remove references to deprecated features
  - [ ] Ensure all examples use current API

### Phase 4: Final Polish
- [ ] **Clean test/temporary files**
  - [ ] Remove MagicMock directory
  - [ ] Clean up one-time maintenance scripts
  - [ ] Archive or remove old test data
- [ ] **Verify everything works**
  - [ ] Run full test suite
  - [ ] Test fresh install experience
  - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with cleanup notes

### Success Criteria
- Repository size reduced by >50% (removing media files)
- No duplicate or deprecated code
- Clear, consistent structure
- All tests pass
- Fresh clone + install works perfectly

## My Actual Workflow

**Real scenario**: "I generated 200 images yesterday, need 20 for a video"

1. **Search & Select** via Claude
   - "Show me cyberpunk portraits from this week"
   - "Find more like these three"
   - "Exclude anything with neon"

2. **Curate & Clean**
   - Mark rejects ‚Üí 'sorted-out/rejected/'
   - Mark maybe-later ‚Üí 'sorted-out/archive/'
   - Track selections with reasons

3. **Prepare for Video**
   - Generate storyboard from selections
   - Create Kling prompts with camera movements
   - Use Flux Kontext for keyframe variations

4. **Project Organization**
   ```
   project-name/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ created/     # New generations
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ selected/    # From global library
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rounds/      # Curation iterations
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exports/     # Final deliverables
   ```

## Recent Achievements (January 2025)

### This Week's Completions ‚úÖ
1. **Multi-Path Storage Architecture** - Store assets across multiple locations with rules
2. **Video Creation Workflow** - Complete system for turning images into videos
3. **Selection & Curation Tools** - Track selections, find similar, soft delete
4. **Cost Management** - Track spending, free tier limits, budget alerts
5. **First-Run Experience** - Interactive setup wizard, better error messages
6. **Understanding Integration** - AI analysis with semantic tags
7. **Auto-Indexing** - Files indexed during organization
8. **Similarity Search** - Perceptual hashing (pHash, dHash, aHash)

### Today's Completions (January 6) ‚úÖ
1. **Redis Removal** - Made Redis optional, file-based events by default
2. **Cost Warnings** - Shows cost estimate before expensive operations
3. **Cost CLI Commands** - `alice cost report/set-budget/providers`
4. **Event Monitor Fixed** - Works with both Redis and file backends

### Architecture Improvements
- File-based event system (Redis now optional)
- DuckDB for search (PostgreSQL removed)
- Configuration-driven paths (no hardcoded test_data/)
- File-first metadata with content addressing
- Cost tracking integrated throughout

## Current State (January 6, 2025)

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- **AI-Native Interface**: Search and organize through Claude/ChatGPT
- **Semantic Search**: Tags, similarity, and natural language queries
- **Multi-Path Storage**: Assets across multiple locations with rules
- **Cost Tracking**: Know exactly what you're spending
- **Project Management**: File-based with budget tracking
- **Video Workflows**: Storyboards, Kling prompts, Flux keyframes

### Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Documentation Confusion**: Still implies this is a product (it's not)
2. **Performance at Scale**: Not tested with 100k+ images yet
3. **Understanding Flag**: No --understand CLI flag (uses config only)

## My Development Principles

1. **It has to work**: I use this daily, can't break it
2. **My money matters**: Track every API call
3. **Simplicity**: I maintain this alone
4. **Natural workflow**: Talk to Claude, not click UIs
5. **File-based**: I want portable data
6. **Test what matters**: Core workflows must work
7. **Document for future me**: I forget things


## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Task
1. Ask: "Is this solving a real user problem?"
2. Ask: "Will this make the system simpler or more complex?"
3. Ask: "Can we test this thoroughly?"
4. Ask: "Will users understand how to use this?"

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Write tests first (TDD)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Clean up old code
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Consider writing an ADR

### Testing Requirements
```bash
# Before ANY commit:
pytest tests/unit/test_new_feature.py -v        # Unit tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v                    # Integration tests  
pytest --cov=alicemultiverse --cov-report=html # Coverage
alice --dry-run                                 # CLI smoke test
```

**Note**: This roadmap follows kanban principles. We work on the highest value task that solves real problems, learn from implementation, and continuously re-evaluate priorities.
