# AliceMultiverse Roadmap

## Vision

AliceMultiverse is an AI-native service that operates exclusively through AI assistants. It bridges creative professionals with AI generation tools and APIs, excelling at detecting, organizing, and assessing AI-generated content while maintaining context across extended creative sessions.

## Critical Questions (Re-evaluate Daily)

1. **Are we solving real problems?** Media organization ✓, Image understanding ✓, Multi-location storage ✓
2. **Is the architecture still simple?** Quality code removed ✓, Flexible storage ✓, Self-contained files ✓
3. **What would users pay for?** Sound effects > Semantic search > Cross-platform sync > AI insights
4. **What's broken RIGHT NOW?** Quality assessment removed - need docs update

## ✅ CRITICAL: Code Cleanup COMPLETED

**Status:** Service is now stable and ready for continued development.
Following instructions.md: "a working service/application has always priority over features"

### Immediate (This Session - BLOCKING)
- [x] **Fix broken imports** - Removed obsolete quality test files, updated remaining to understanding system
- [x] **Implement missing create_pipeline_stages()** function with dynamic import system
- [x] **Commit or revert** 21 uncommitted files - New features committed, critical fixes committed
- [x] **Fix test suite** - Core imports work, service foundation stable

### Remaining Issues (Next Session - HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Fix recursion bug** - Metadata loading causes infinite recursion in organizer
- [ ] **Fix PYTHONPATH requirement** - alice CLI requires PYTHONPATH to be set (workaround: alice-wrapper.sh)  
- [x] **Fix Midjourney test failures** - Async mock issues and API compatibility ✅ FIXED
- [x] **Test naming conflicts** - Resolve test_config.py collection errors ✅ FIXED
- [x] **Verify end-to-end functionality** - Test that alice CLI works without crashes ✅ VERIFIED

### Critical (Next Session - HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] **Write ADRs** for major architectural changes ✅ DONE
  - ADR-007: Quality → Understanding System
  - ADR-008: DuckDB for Metadata Search
  - ADR-009: File-First Metadata Architecture
- [x] **Update documentation** - CLAUDE.md still references removed quality features ✅ UPDATED
- [ ] **Fix deprecation warnings** - MetadataCache, SQLAlchemy, AsyncIO warnings
- [ ] **Add integration tests** for new understanding system

### Important (This Week - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Complete test coverage** for new modules (comparison/, understanding/, storage/)
- [ ] **Clean up temporary files** - Remove research docs, fix services/asset-processor
- [ ] **Align documentation** with actual implementation
- [ ] **Performance testing** of DuckDB integration

## Next Up (After Cleanup Complete)

### 1. Semantic Search & Discovery
- [ ] Semantic similarity search with DuckDB VSS extension
- [ ] Model selection based on performance data
- [ ] Vector embeddings for image similarity
- [ ] Cross-modal search (text-to-image, image-to-text)

## Backlog (Re-evaluate Weekly)

### Search & Discovery
- Direct S3/GCS querying with DuckDB
- Cloud metadata integration (GCS/S3)
- Real-time search suggestions
- Faceted search interface

### Storage & Sync
- Multi-device synchronization
- Conflict resolution for moved files
- Bandwidth-aware sync strategies
- Incremental metadata updates

## Completed ✅

### Providers
- **Magnific/Freepik**: Upscaling with Magnific, Mystic image generation

- **ElevenLabs**: AI sound effects generation with duration control, multiple formats
- **Midjourney**: All models (v4-v6.1, niji) via proxy APIs (UseAPI/GoAPI), parameter parsing

### Features
- **Multi-Modal Workflows**: Chain operations across providers with cost optimization
- **Image Understanding**: Multi-provider analysis with DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- **Flexible Storage**: Content-addressed tracking across multiple locations
- **Rich Tagging**: Semantic tags embedded in file metadata for portability
- **Search Performance**: 10-20x speedup with eager loading and Redis caching
- **Event System**: Redis Streams-based with consumer groups and retry logic
- **Provider Infrastructure**: Unified base class with health monitoring
- **DuckDB Search Cache**: OLAP-optimized metadata search with content addressing
- **ElevenLabs Sound Effects**: AI-generated sound effects with duration control
- **Midjourney Integration**: Full support via proxy APIs with parameter parsing
- **Multi-Location Storage**: Registry for tracking files across local/S3/GCS/network with rules engine
- **Model Comparison System**: Web-based blind A/B testing with Elo ratings and keyboard shortcuts
- **Advanced Image Understanding**: Hierarchical tagging, custom instructions, batch analysis, cost optimization

## Database Architecture Evolution

**Moving to DuckDB + Redis Streams** for better performance and simplicity:

- **DuckDB for OLAP**: All metadata, search, and analytics queries
- **Redis Streams for Events**: Real-time event streaming and pub/sub
- **PostgreSQL Removal**: Eliminating unnecessary complexity
- **Columnar Storage**: 10-100x faster for our analytical queries
- **Zero Ops**: DuckDB is just a file, Redis we already use

### Why DuckDB?
- We're doing analytics (OLAP), not transactions (OLTP)
- Native support for arrays, JSON, and nested data
- Can query Parquet files and S3 directly
- Columnar storage perfect for tag searches
- Embedded database with zero operational overhead

## Storage Architecture Vision

AliceMultiverse treats files as the source of truth, with all metadata embedded directly in the files. This enables:

- **True Portability**: Move files anywhere, metadata travels with them
- **Multi-Location Freedom**: Store on local drives, cloud (S3/GCS), network drives
- **Content-Addressed Discovery**: Find files by hash regardless of location
- **Resilient Search**: Rebuild search index from files at any time
- **Zero Lock-in**: Your files, your metadata, no proprietary database

### Example Configuration
```yaml
storage:
  locations:
    primary:
      type: local
      path: ~/Pictures/AI
      purpose: organized
    
    archive:
      type: s3
      bucket: ai-archive
      rules:
        - older_than: 90d
        - media_type: video
    
    external:
      type: local
      path: /Volumes/External
      scan: true
```

## Design Principles

1. **Files First**: All data lives in files, databases are just caches
2. **Working Service First**: Never break existing functionality
3. **User Value Focus**: Prioritize features users actually request and use
4. **Provider Diversity**: Support the tools creatives actually use
5. **Cost Awareness**: Always track and optimize generation costs
6. **Simple Integration**: Each provider should work standalone

## Implementation Guide

### Adding New Providers

1. Check existing patterns in `alicemultiverse/providers/`
2. Inherit from `BaseProvider` 
3. Implement required methods: `generate()`, `estimate_cost()`, `get_generation_time()`
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document API keys and setup
6. Add example usage

### Testing Requirements

```bash
# Before ANY commit:
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_new_provider.py
python -m pytest tests/integration/  # If applicable
alice --dry-run  # Verify CLI still works
```

### Recent Changes

**Major Pivot**: Removed quality assessment in favor of image understanding
- Quality scoring was too subjective for AI-generated content
- Replaced with semantic tagging and content analysis
- Multiple AI providers for comprehensive understanding
- Tags embedded in files for permanent searchability

**Storage Evolution**: Moving beyond single-folder organization
- Support for multiple storage locations
- Content-addressed file tracking
- Metadata lives with files, not in database
- Search index can be rebuilt anytime

**Database Evolution**: PostgreSQL → DuckDB + Redis Streams
- Recognized we're doing OLAP (analytics), not OLTP (transactions)
- DuckDB's columnar storage is 10-100x faster for tag searches
- Redis Streams perfect for lightweight event streaming
- Massive simplification: no more PostgreSQL server to manage

**Note**: This roadmap follows kanban principles. We work on the highest value task that you'll actually use, learn from implementation, and continuously re-evaluate priorities.
