# AliceMultiverse Roadmap - Personal Creative Tool

## Vision

My personal AI creative workflow orchestrator, accessed through Claude. Built for managing thousands of AI-generated images, semantic search, and video creation. Not a product - a personal tool that solves my specific problems.

## Daily Reality Check

1. **What's broken TODAY?** Fix it first
2. **What costs money?** Track and optimize it
3. **What's complex?** Simplify it
4. **What's unused?** Remove it

## Current State (December 2024)

### ✅ Core Features Working
- **AI Interface**: 36 MCP tools for complete creative control
- **Smart Search**: Semantic search, style matching, similarity detection
- **Video Export**: EDL/XML for DaVinci Resolve, JSON for CapCut
- **Music Integration**: Beat detection, mood analysis, sync tools
- **Cost Tracking**: Detailed API usage reports with budget alerts
- **Understanding System**: Multi-provider analysis with 20-40% cost savings

### 🚧 Active Development
1. **Documentation Updates**: Critical guides for new features
2. **Advanced Scene Transitions**: AI-powered smooth visual flow
3. **Smart Project Templates**: Genre-specific video workflows
4. **Performance at Scale**: Optimization for 10k+ image collections

## Development Principles

1. **Working > Perfect**: Fix what's broken before adding new
2. **Track costs**: Every API call = money spent
3. **Simple > Complex**: Less code = less bugs
4. **Files > Servers**: Everything portable and local
5. **Test reality**: Focus on actual daily workflow
6. **Document clearly**: Future me needs to understand

## Success Metrics

- Can I find any image in seconds using natural queries?
- Is my monthly AI spend under control and visible?
- Does my daily workflow have zero friction?
- Can I explain what each module does in one sentence?

## Priority Framework

**Daily Reality Check** (from top of file):
1. What's broken TODAY? → Immediate priority
2. What costs money? → Track and optimize
3. What's complex? → Simplify it
4. What's unused? → Delete it

**Remember**: This is MY personal tool. Every decision should optimize for my specific workflow, not hypothetical users.
