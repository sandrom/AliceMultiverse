# AliceMultiverse Roadmap

## Vision

AliceMultiverse is an AI-native creative workflow orchestrator that enables collaborative exploration between humans and AI. It excels at understanding large image collections, facilitating creative discovery, and supporting multiple video creation workflows - from storyboard-driven to emergent visual narratives. The system maintains context across extended creative sessions, helping users navigate from thousands of possibilities to polished video stories.

## Critical Questions (Re-evaluate Daily)

1. **Are we solving real problems?** 
   - Media organization ✓
   - Collaborative image discovery ✓ 
   - Video creation workflows ✓
   - Large collection navigation ✓
2. **Is the architecture still simple?** 
   - Understanding over quality ✓
   - File-first metadata ✓
   - AI-native interface ✓
3. **What would users pay for?** 
   - Creative workflow acceleration
   - AI-assisted curation from thousands to dozens
   - Intelligent prompt generation for video
   - Collaborative exploration with context
4. **What's broken RIGHT NOW?** 
   - Recursion bug in metadata loading
   - Need image presentation in chat UI
   - Missing similarity search
   - No soft-delete workflow

## ✅ CRITICAL: Code Cleanup COMPLETED

**Status:** Service is now stable and ready for continued development.
Following instructions.md: "a working service/application has always priority over features"

### Immediate (This Session - BLOCKING)
- [x] **Fix broken imports** - Removed obsolete quality test files, updated remaining to understanding system
- [x] **Implement missing create_pipeline_stages()** function with dynamic import system
- [x] **Commit or revert** 21 uncommitted files - New features committed, critical fixes committed
- [x] **Fix test suite** - Core imports work, service foundation stable

### IMMEDIATE: Enable Creative Workflows (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Image Presentation API** - Return images to AI for display in chat
- [ ] **Selection Tracking** - Record which images user selected and why
- [ ] **Similarity Search** - "Find more like these selected ones"
- [ ] **Soft Delete API** - Move rejected images to 'sorted-out' folder
- [ ] **Exclusion List** - Skip 'sorted-out' folders in scans
- [ ] **Prompt Generation** - Create engaging Kling prompts from selected images

### Important (This Week - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Image Presentation UI** - Show images in AI chat for selection
- [ ] **Feedback Loop** - Capture user preferences and reasons
- [ ] **Similarity Search** - Find images based on selected examples
- [ ] **Soft Delete Implementation** - Move unwanted images to excluded folders
- [ ] **Complete test coverage** for new modules (comparison/, understanding/, storage/)
- [ ] **Performance testing** of DuckDB integration

## Next Up: Creative Workflow Support

### Implementation Plan for Image Discovery Workflow

**User Story**: "I have thousands of images and need to find a small set for video creation"

1. **Initial Browse**
   - AI shows grid of images based on initial query
   - User clicks to select/deselect with reasons
   - AI learns preferences in real-time

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - "Show me more cyberpunk but less neon"
   - "These three work well together, find complementary ones"
   - "This style but different subjects"

3. **Curation Tools**
   - Mark broken/unwanted → moves to 'sorted-out/broken/'
   - Mark maybe-later → moves to 'sorted-out/archive/'
   - These folders excluded from future searches

4. **Video Preparation**
   - Selected images → generate Kling prompts
   - Suggest transitions and narrative flow
   - Export selection with prompts

### Technical Requirements

1. **Search API Enhancements**
   ```python
   # Current: Simple tag search
   search(tags=["cyberpunk"])
   
   # Needed: Similarity and exclusion
   search(
       similar_to=["image_hash_1", "image_hash_2"],
       exclude_tags=["neon"],
       exclude_folders=["sorted-out/"],
       limit=20
   )
   ```

2. **Selection Tracking**
   ```python
   # Store user feedback
   track_selection({
       "image_hash": "abc123",
       "selected": True,
       "reason": "love the mood and color palette",
       "session_id": "exploration_001"
   })
   ```

3. **Soft Delete API**
   ```python
   # Move to sorted folder
   soft_delete({
       "image_hash": "def456",
       "reason": "broken/artifacts",
       "destination": "sorted-out/broken/"
   })
   ```

## Database Architecture Evolution

**Moving to DuckDB + Redis Streams** for better performance and simplicity:

- **DuckDB for OLAP**: All metadata, search, and analytics queries
- **Redis Streams for Events**: Real-time event streaming and pub/sub
- **PostgreSQL Removal**: Eliminating unnecessary complexity
- **Columnar Storage**: 10-100x faster for our analytical queries
- **Zero Ops**: DuckDB is just a file, Redis we already use

### Why DuckDB?
- We're doing analytics (OLAP), not transactions (OLTP)
- Native support for arrays, JSON, and nested data
- Can query Parquet files and S3 directly
- Columnar storage perfect for tag searches
- Embedded database with zero operational overhead

## Storage Architecture Vision

AliceMultiverse treats files as the source of truth, with all metadata embedded directly in the files. This enables:

- **True Portability**: Move files anywhere, metadata travels with them
- **Multi-Location Freedom**: Store on local drives, cloud (S3/GCS), network drives
- **Content-Addressed Discovery**: Find files by hash regardless of location
- **Resilient Search**: Rebuild search index from files at any time
- **Zero Lock-in**: Your files, your metadata, no proprietary database

### Example Configuration
```yaml
storage:
  locations:
    primary:
      type: local
      path: ~/Pictures/AI
      purpose: organized
    
    archive:
      type: s3
      bucket: ai-archive
      rules:
        - older_than: 90d
        - media_type: video
    
    external:
      type: local
      path: /Volumes/External
      scan: true
```

## Design Principles

1. **Files First**: All data lives in files, databases are just caches
2. **Working Service First**: Never break existing functionality
3. **User Value Focus**: Prioritize features users actually request and use
4. **Provider Diversity**: Support the tools creatives actually use
5. **Cost Awareness**: Always track and optimize generation costs
6. **Simple Integration**: Each provider should work standalone

## Implementation Guide

### Adding New Providers

1. Check existing patterns in `alicemultiverse/providers/`
2. Inherit from `BaseProvider` 
3. Implement required methods: `generate()`, `estimate_cost()`, `get_generation_time()`
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document API keys and setup
6. Add example usage

### Testing Requirements

```bash
# Before ANY commit:
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_new_provider.py
python -m pytest tests/integration/  # If applicable
alice --dry-run  # Verify CLI still works
```

### Recent Changes

**Major Pivot**: Removed quality assessment in favor of image understanding
- Quality scoring was too subjective for AI-generated content
- Replaced with semantic tagging and content analysis
- Multiple AI providers for comprehensive understanding
- Tags embedded in files for permanent searchability

**Storage Evolution**: Moving beyond single-folder organization
- Support for multiple storage locations
- Content-addressed file tracking
- Metadata lives with files, not in database
- Search index can be rebuilt anytime

**Database Evolution**: PostgreSQL → DuckDB + Redis Streams
- Recognized we're doing OLAP (analytics), not OLTP (transactions)
- DuckDB's columnar storage is 10-100x faster for tag searches
- Redis Streams perfect for lightweight event streaming
- Massive simplification: no more PostgreSQL server to manage

**Note**: This roadmap follows kanban principles. We work on the highest value task that you'll actually use, learn from implementation, and continuously re-evaluate priorities.
