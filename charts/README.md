# Helm Charts

This directory contains Helm charts for deploying AliceMultiverse to Kubernetes.

## What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, like apt/yum for Linux or homebrew for Mac.

## For Users

You can safely ignore this directory - AliceMultiverse works great as a simple command-line tool without any Kubernetes setup.

## For Developers

These charts enable deploying AliceMultiverse as a scalable microservice. See the [Kubernetes deployment guide](../k8s/README.md) for details.
