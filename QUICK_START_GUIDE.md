# AliceMultiverse Quick Start Guide

## üéØ Your Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. **Start the MCP Server** (Do This First!)

```bash
# In the AliceMultiverse directory
python -m alicemultiverse mcp-server
```

Then add to Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alice": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "alicemultiverse", "mcp-server"],
      "cwd": "/Users/sandro/Documents/AI/AliceMultiverse"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and you'll have access to **106 AI creative tools**!

### 2. **Set Up Your API Keys**

```bash
# Run the provider setup script
python examples/setup_providers.py

# Or use the CLI
python -m alicemultiverse keys setup
```

Recommended providers:
- **OpenAI**: Best for understanding image content
- **Anthropic**: Great for artistic analysis
- **Google AI**: Good for technical details

### 3. **Test Basic Organization**

```bash
# Test organizing your AI images
python examples/test_organization.py

# Or use the CLI directly
python -m alicemultiverse debug organize \
  -i ~/Downloads/ai-images \
  -o ~/Pictures/AI-Organized \
  --dry-run
```

### 4. **Explore Advanced Features**

Once MCP is connected, ask Claude to:

#### üîç **Search & Discovery**
- "Find all my cyberpunk portraits from last week"
- "Show me images similar to this one"
- "Find all images generated with DALL-E 3"
