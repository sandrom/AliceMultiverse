# AsyncAPI Specification

This directory contains the AsyncAPI specification for AliceMultiverse's event-driven architecture.

## What is AsyncAPI?

AsyncAPI is like OpenAPI (Swagger) but for event-driven architectures. It documents:
- What events the system publishes
- What events the system consumes
- Event schemas and formats

## For Users

You can safely ignore this directory - it's for developers building event-driven integrations.

## For Developers

See `asyncapi.yaml` for the complete event specification.
