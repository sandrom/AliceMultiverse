"Suggest some exploratory style variations"
```

## Tracking Workflows

### Start a Workflow

```python
# Begin tracking
"Start tracking my image generation workflow"

# With project context
"Start video creation workflow for my cyberpunk project"
```

### End and Review

```python
# Successful completion
"End workflow - it was successful, quality 0.9, rating 5 stars"

# With feedback
"End workflow - successful but needed manual color adjustments"

# Failed workflow
"End workflow - not successful, wrong mood for the project"
```

## Recommendation Types

### 1. Preset Recommendations

Your proven combinations:
```python
"Show me my signature style presets"

# Returns combinations like:
# - "Signature Style": Your most successful preferences
# - "Morning Creative": Styles that work in morning hours
# - "Project X Style": Established style for specific project
```

### 2. Variations

Fresh takes on successful styles:
```python
"Show me variations of my recent successful styles"

# Returns similar but different options:
# - Base style with new color palette
# - Same mood with different technique
# - Complementary additions
```

### 3. Explorations

Expand your horizons:
```python
"Show me exploratory recommendations"

# Suggests underused categories:
# - "Try dramatic lighting" (if you rarely use it)
# - "Explore abstract subjects" (new territory)
# - Safe combinations with new elements
```

### 4. Trending

What's working recently:
```python
"Show me trending styles from my recent work"

# Shows what you're gravitating toward
# Helps identify emerging preferences
```

## Pattern Analysis

### Analyze Your Patterns

```python
# Full analysis
"Analyze my style patterns for the last 30 days"

# Specific timeframe
"Show style patterns from the last 2 weeks"
```

Returns insights like:
- Co-occurrence patterns (what works together)
- Temporal patterns (time-based preferences)
- Project-specific patterns
- Evolution trends

### Actionable Insights

The system generates insights with priorities:

**High Priority**
- Frequent failures to address

- Workflow enhancements

**Low Priority**
- Minor tweaks
- Experimental suggestions

## Style Evolution

### Track Changes

```python
# View evolution
"Show my style evolution over the last month"

```

### 2. Honest Feedback

Rate honestly for better learning:
```python
# Good result
"End workflow - successful, quality 0.8"

# Needs work
"End workflow - not successful, colors too muted"
```

### 3. Explore Recommendations

Try suggested combinations:
```python
# Weekly exploration
"Show me one exploratory recommendation to try"

# Test and track results
"That new technique worked well with my style"
```

"Analyze my patterns and show insights"

# Act on high-priority items
"Implement suggested workflow improvements"
```

## Advanced Usage
