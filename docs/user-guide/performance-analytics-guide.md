# Performance Analytics Guide

Track and optimize your creative workflows with AliceMultiverse's Performance Analytics system. This guide shows how to monitor workflow performance, analyze export patterns, and get actionable improvement suggestions.

## Overview

The Performance Analytics system automatically tracks:
- **Workflow Performance**: Success rates, durations, resource usage
- **Export Patterns**: Format preferences, platform adoption, quality trends
- **User Behavior**: Manual adjustments, preview usage, iteration patterns
- **Error Tracking**: Common failures and their frequencies
- **Improvement Opportunities**: AI-powered suggestions for optimization

## Quick Start

### Start Tracking

```python
# Begin analytics session
"Start an analytics session to track my workflow"

# This begins tracking all operations until you end the session
```

### View Performance

```python
# Get performance insights
"Show me performance insights for the last 30 days"

# Returns:
# - Success rates by workflow type
# - Average durations
# - Common errors
# - Improvement suggestions
```

### End Session

```python
# End session and get summary
"End analytics session and show me the summary"

# Returns complete session metrics
```

## Tracking Workflows

### Automatic Tracking

When analytics is active, the following are automatically tracked:
- Timeline creation and editing
- Export operations (format, platform, duration)
- API calls (provider, cost, success)
- User actions (adjustments, previews, redos)

### Export Analytics

```python
# Analyze export patterns
"Show me export analytics for Instagram formats"

# Returns:
# - Export count by format
# - Platform compatibility scores
# - Iteration patterns
# - Quality trends
```

## Performance Insights

### Success Metrics

```python
# View workflow success rates
"Get performance insights for video creation workflows"

# Shows:
# - Total workflows: 150
# - Success rate: 92%
# - Average duration: 3.5 minutes
# - Resource usage: 500MB avg memory
```

### Error Analysis

```python
# See common errors
"What are the most common workflow errors?"

# Returns top errors with:
# - Frequency
# - Affected workflows
# - Suggested fixes
```

## Export Patterns

### Format Analysis

```python
# Analyze export format usage
"Show export analytics for EDL format"

# Returns:
# - Total exports: 45
# - Success rate: 98%
# - Average clips: 25
# - Common platforms: DaVinci Resolve
```

### Platform Performance

```python
# Check platform-specific metrics
"How are my TikTok exports performing?"

# Shows:
# - Compatibility score: 0.85
# - Common optimizations needed
# - Average edits before publish: 2.3
# - Adoption rate: 75%
```

## Improvement Suggestions

### Get Recommendations

```python
# Get improvement suggestions
"Give me top 5 improvement suggestions"

# Returns prioritized improvements:
# 1. Automate Common Adjustments (High Priority)
#    - Color corrections applied 80% of time
#    - Could save 3-5 minutes per workflow
#    
# 2. Improve Export Preview (Medium Priority)
#    - Users export 3.5 times per timeline
#    - Better preview could reduce to 1-2
```

### Implementation Categories

Improvements are categorized by:

**Workflow Efficiency**
- Automation opportunities
- Default setting optimizations
- Template creation suggestions

**Performance Optimization**
- Speed improvements
- Memory usage reduction
- Parallel processing opportunities

**Quality Enhancement**
- Resolution preservation
- Format optimization
- Platform compatibility

**Error Reduction**
- Validation improvements
- Recovery mechanisms
- Better error messages

## Usage Patterns

### Time-Based Analysis

```python
# View trends over time
"Show me performance trends for the last 60 days"

# Displays:
# - Workflow volume by week
# - Success rate trends
# - Quality improvements
# - Peak usage times
```

### Behavior Patterns

The system tracks:
- **Preview Usage**: How many times before committing
- **Manual Adjustments**: Common tweaks and modifications
- **Iteration Patterns**: Exports per timeline
- **Time to Final**: Duration from start to completion

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Sessions

Start analytics sessions for focused work:
```python
"Start analytics for today's video project"
# ... do your work ...
"End session and show insights"
```

### 2. Review Weekly

Check performance weekly:
```python
"Show me this week's performance summary"
```

### 3. Act on Suggestions

Implement high-priority improvements:
```python
"What's my top improvement opportunity?"
# Implement the suggestion
# Track if it helps
```

### 4. Monitor Trends

Watch for patterns:
```python
"Are my export success rates improving?"
```

## Advanced Analytics

### Custom Time Ranges

```python
# Analyze specific periods
"Show performance for workflows from December"

# Compare periods
"Compare this month's performance to last month"
```

### Workflow-Specific Analysis

```python
# Deep dive into specific workflows
"Analyze timeline export performance"

# Shows targeted metrics and suggestions
```

### Cost Analysis

```python
# Track API costs in workflows
"What's my average API cost per video creation?"

# Helps optimize provider usage
```

## Metrics Explained

### Workflow Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage completed successfully
- **Duration**: Time from start to completion
- **API Calls**: External service usage
- **Manual Adjustments**: User interventions required

### Export Metrics
- **Compatibility Score**: How well exports match platform specs
- **Iteration Count**: Exports per timeline
- **Adoption Rate**: Percentage actually published
- **Quality Metrics**: Resolution, duration, complexity

### Performance Indicators
- **Memory Usage**: Peak RAM consumption
- **Processing Speed**: Operations per second
- **Cache Efficiency**: Hit rate for repeated operations
- **Error Frequency**: Failures per workflow type

## Troubleshooting

### "No data available"
- Ensure analytics session is active
- Check if operations have been performed
- Verify time range includes activity

### "Suggestions not relevant"
- Accumulate more usage data
- Vary your workflow types
- Review and rate suggestions

### "Metrics seem incorrect"
- End and restart session
- Check for background operations
- Verify workflow completion status

## Integration Examples

### With Timeline Preview
```python
# Track preview efficiency
"Start analytics session"
"Preview timeline for my video"
# Make adjustments
"Export timeline"
"How many previews did I need?"
```

### With Multi-Version Export
```python
# Analyze platform performance
"Track my Instagram export success"
"Export for all social platforms"
"Which platform has best compatibility?"
```

### With Natural Language Edits
```python
# Monitor edit patterns
"Start tracking my editing session"
"Make the intro punchier"
"Add breathing room"
"What edits do I make most often?"
```

## Privacy & Data
