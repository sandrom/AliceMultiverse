## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Basic organization (uses defaults from settings.yaml)
alice

# With quality assessment
alice --quality

# Watch mode
alice --watch

# Pipeline processing (4 options)
alice --pipeline brisque                     # BRISQUE only (free)
alice --pipeline brisque-sightengine         # BRISQUE + SightEngine (~$0.001/image)
alice --pipeline brisque-claude              # BRISQUE + Claude (~$0.02/image)
alice --pipeline brisque-sightengine-claude  # All three (~$0.021/image)

# Dry run preview
alice --dry-run
```

### Common Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--quality` | `-q` | Enable quality assessment |
| `--watch` | `-w` | Watch mode |
| `--move` | `-m` | Move instead of copy |
| `--dry-run` | `-n` | Preview only |
| `--force-reindex` | `-f` | Bypass cache |

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
Begin with basic organization before adding quality assessment or pipelines.

### 2. Use Dry Runs
Always preview large operations with `--dry-run` first.

### 3. Monitor Costs
Check pipeline costs before processing large collections.

### 4. Regular Backups
Keep backups of your original files, especially when using `--move`.

### 5. Cache Wisely
Let the cache work for you - avoid `--force-reindex` unless necessary.
