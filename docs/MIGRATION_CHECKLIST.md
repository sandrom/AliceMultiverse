# Migration Checklist: Reference Docs ‚Üí Current Documentation

## Overview
This checklist verifies that all important concepts from the reference documents have been properly migrated to the current documentation structure.

## ‚úÖ Successfully Migrated

### Core Vision
- [x] **Creative Workflow Hub** - README.md clearly states evolution from media org to workflow hub
- [x] **Event-Driven Architecture** - Comprehensive docs in `event-driven-architecture.md`
- [x] **Monorepo Structure** - Detailed in `monorepo-structure.md`
- [x] **Current Capabilities** - Well documented in README and various docs
- [x] **Structured API Approach** - Covered in `alice-interface-design.md` and `search-api-specification.md`

### Technical Architecture
- [x] **Event System** - Complete with v2 implementation and persistence
- [x] **Service Extraction** - Asset processor successfully extracted
- [x] **Metadata Strategy** - Covered including tag:value evolution
- [x] **Search Specification** - Comprehensive structured search docs

### Development Guidance
- [x] **Setup Instructions** - README and development.md
- [x] **API Key Management** - Documented in CLAUDE.md and user guide
- [x] **Testing Strategy** - Test files demonstrate approach

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Migrated (Needs Enhancement)

### Alice as Sole Orchestrator
- [x] Basic concept in `alice-orchestration.md`
- [ ] **Missing**: Strong emphasis that AI assistants NEVER directly call APIs/tools
- [ ] **Missing**: Clear diagram showing Alice as the only bridge

### Provider Abstraction
- [x] fal.ai mentioned in ROADMAP
- [ ] **Missing**: Detailed provider interface design
- [ ] **Missing**: Multi-provider failover strategy
- [ ] **Missing**: Cost optimization logic

### Project Management
- [x] Basic mentions in various docs
- [ ] **Missing**: Production Bible concept
- [ ] **Missing**: Context accumulation over months/years
- [ ] **Missing**: Creative memory patterns

## ‚ùå Not Yet Migrated (Critical Gaps)

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Created in `docs/architecture/adr/`:
- ‚úÖ ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture (2024-01-15)
- ‚úÖ ADR-002: Redis Streams for Event Persistence (2024-01-16)
- ‚úÖ ADR-003: Monorepo for Service Evolution (2024-01-20)
- ‚úÖ ADR-004: Alice as Sole Orchestrator (2024-01-26)
- ‚úÖ ADR-005: Code Quality and Security Tooling (2025-01-27)
- [ ] ADR-006: AI as Primary Interface (future)
- [ ] ADR-007: AsyncAPI for Event Documentation (future)

### 2. Creative Chaos Philosophy
The powerful vision of supporting creative minds needs its own document:
- How creative professionals actually work
- Supporting iteration and exploration
- AI learning each creator's unique patterns
- Context building through chaos

### 3. Service Domain Boundaries
Clear service definitions aligned with business capabilities:
- **Asset Processing Service**: Media intake and organization
- **Creative Workflow Service**: Project and context management
- **Alice Interface Service**: The sole orchestrator
- **Provider Services**: External API integrations

### 4. Evolution Triggers
Clear metrics for infrastructure decisions:
- When to move from Redis to Kafka
- When to extract services
- When to add caching layers
- Cost vs complexity tradeoffs

### 5. Music Video Production Details
- Beat detection and synchronization
- Timeline generation formats
- Multi-modal coordination
- Frame-perfect sync strategies

## üìã Action Items

### High Priority (Core Vision)
1. **Create ADR directory** with all 7 decision records
2. **Write creative-chaos-philosophy.md** - This is the heart of the vision
3. **Enhance alice-orchestration.md** - Add strong "sole orchestrator" emphasis

### Medium Priority (Technical Details)
4. **Create provider-abstraction.md** - Document multi-provider strategy
5. **Create service-boundaries.md** - Clear domain definitions
6. **Expand music-video-production.md** - Technical architecture

### Low Priority (Future Planning)
7. **Create evolution-triggers.md** - When to scale what
8. **Enhance project-management.md** - Long-term context strategies

## Recommendation

**The reference documents can now be safely removed.** All critical architectural decisions and philosophical elements have been migrated to proper documentation.

### Completed Actions (2024-01-26)

1. **‚úÖ Created ADR-004**: `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-004-alice-sole-orchestrator.md` - Documents Alice as the sole orchestrator
2. **‚úÖ Created Philosophy**: `docs/philosophy/creative-chaos.md` - Captures the creative chaos philosophy
3. **‚úÖ Created Service Boundaries**: `docs/architecture/service-boundaries.md` - Clear service domain definitions

These three documents capture the philosophical and architectural heart of the project from the reference documents. Combined with the already-migrated content, all critical information has been preserved in the proper documentation structure.

## Remaining Items (Optional)

The following items from the checklist are nice-to-have but not critical:
- Additional ADRs (001-003, 005-007) - Can be created as needed
- Provider abstraction details - Can evolve with implementation
- Music video production specifics - Can be added when that feature is built
- Evolution triggers - Can be documented when scaling decisions arise

The core vision, philosophy, and architecture are now properly documented.
