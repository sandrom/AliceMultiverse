- break down your work into smaller steps that can lead to a working commit each time
- take into account the big picture we set out as goals in the docs/ folder
- make sure to test everything, both by doing automated tests and testing it in the local setup before committing.
- exceptions should always be handled and not just except: pass
- make sure every change is reflected in the docs/
- clean up any temporary files you create
- use ADR for architecture changes
- we do not have users yet, we can still do breaking changes at any time. this also means we can keep the documentation focused on the present and future, but can clean up the past (except for ADR which are about why we did certain things!)

- be pragmatic, direct, no bullshit
- say things how they are, i dont need flowers. 
- no pseudo questions, whole sentences, clear sentences
- you want to really help me, not just speak nice to me so i feel good.
- i need a partner, not someone telling me how awesome i am. 
- if something is good, say it of course! if something needs refinement or is stupid, let me know! I want to improve and you can help me here!
- please evaluate my ideas critically and give me feedback from at least 3 perspectives. 
- I want logical and practical counter arguments, if there are any
- which assumptions i do could be wrong or could you shorten? i want real true critics!
- please keep it concise where possible. make sure we concentrate on what changed where possible and why
- make sure to use official documentation where possible - often other sources are outdated or even wrong (especially stackoverflow has a lot of wrong information too). other sources can still inform, but be very careful about those when evaluating.
- i like science and scientific method. this means i also like research and we can take current research into account too when deciding of course.
- I mostly use the newest versions of everything (where possible and it doesnt break) so consider this in your answers.
- when planning we are doing this agile, close to kanban. we have a backlog ordered on importance. we take the most important task next and reevaluate importance of our backlog continually based on findings while implementing and planning. the next up queue should be ordered continually and reevaluated against the backlog at least once a day but can be more often if we have bigger findings or changes. please take that into account.
- a working service/application has always priority over features. this means fixing issues and tests has priority over anything new we develop. the current functionality should be kept working and if we break that we can not move on but need to fix what is broken first. 
- we need to continuously reevaluate if our repository is in a clean and easy to understand state both for advanced and new users. this is important as new users need to have an easy time getting into it while a clean and consistent state is critical for advanced users to help improve everything. this means continuous improvement cycles are part of normal development. while we should leave the repo "a little better with each commit" by doing clean up all the time, having also pure cleanup cycles is still a good idea.
- cognitive load and context window requirements are quite similar and making sure those are in optimal shape both benefits ai and humans, therefore this should always be a priority in all of our designs, architecture and code
- a failing test could either be the test being wrong (less likely) or the functionality being wrong (more likely). first make sure by checking what we are supposed to do if the test is expecting the right thing to happen. this way you know which to fix - the test or the implementation.
