# Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all remaining functionality for the AliceMultiverse media organizer to make all tests pass (115 tests total).

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. MediaOrganizer (alicemultiverse/organizer/media_organizer.py)
- Complete implementation of the main organizer class
- File discovery and filtering by media type (PNG, JPG, WebP, HEIC)
- AI source detection from filenames and metadata
- BRISQUE quality assessment integration
- UnifiedCache system with SHA256 content hashing
- Watch mode with signal handling
- Progress bars with tqdm
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

### 2. Keys CLI (alicemultiverse/core/keys/cli.py)
- Created new CLI module for API key management
- Implemented all subcommands: setup, set, get, delete, list
- Interactive setup wizard for easy configuration
- macOS Keychain integration for secure storage
- Environment variable fallback for containers

### 3. Bug Fixes and Improvements

#### Configuration Management
- Fixed OmegaConf override handling
- Added missing configuration keys (ai_generators, file_types)
- Updated default configuration structure

#### Quality Assessment
- Fixed BRISQUE availability checking for test mocking
- Added support for palette mode images
- Improved image conversion handling

#### Unified Cache System
- Implemented UnifiedCache class consolidating all caching functionality
- Content-addressed storage in .metadata folders
- WebP and HEIC metadata embedding support
- Integration with optional database backend
- Fixed cache path structure with sharding

#### Watch Mode
- Fixed KeyboardInterrupt propagation for proper exit code (130)
- Added signal handling for graceful shutdown

## Test Results
- Unit Tests: 102 passing
- Integration Tests: 13 passing
- Total: 115 tests passing

## Key Features Working
1. ✅ Basic file organization by date/project/source
2. ✅ AI source detection from filenames
3. ✅ BRISQUE quality assessment with star ratings
4. ✅ Metadata caching for performance
5. ✅ Watch mode for continuous monitoring
6. ✅ API key management (keychain, env, config)
7. ✅ Dry run mode
8. ✅ Move vs copy operations
9. ✅ Progress tracking
10. ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Notes
- Pipeline functionality (multi-stage assessment) is stubbed but not implemented
- Video metadata extraction would require ffprobe integration
- HEIF support requires pillow_heif package
