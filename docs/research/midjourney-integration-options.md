# Midjourney Integration Options Research

## Overview

Midjourney doesn't provide an official API, so integration requires using third-party proxy services or Discord automation. Here are the available options:

## Option 1: Proxy API Services

### 1. Midjourney API by UseAPI
- **URL**: https://useapi.net/midjourney
- **Pricing**: Starting at $25/month for 100 generations
- **Features**:
  - RESTful API
  - Webhook support
  - Image variations and upscaling
  - Progress tracking
  - Parameter parsing

### 2. Replicate Midjourney Models
- **URL**: https://replicate.com
- **Note**: Uses unofficial/reverse-engineered models
- **Pricing**: Pay per generation
- **Limitations**: Not actual Midjourney, quality may vary

### 3. GoAPI Midjourney Service  
- **URL**: https://goapi.ai/midjourney-api
- **Pricing**: $29/month starter
- **Features**:
  - Discord bot integration
  - Queue management
  - Batch processing

### 4. ProxyAPI.ru
- **URL**: https://proxyapi.ru/midjourney
- **Pricing**: ~$30/month
- **Features**:
  - Direct Discord integration
  - All Midjourney features
  - Russian-based service

## Option 2: Discord Automation

### Self-Hosted Discord Bot
- Use discord.py or similar
- Monitor bot responses
- Parse generation results
- **Pros**: Full control, no third-party dependency
- **Cons**: Complex, may violate Discord ToS

### Midjourney-cli Tools
- Various GitHub projects
- Automate Discord interactions
- **Risk**: Account ban possibility

## Recommended Approach

For AliceMultiverse, I recommend using **UseAPI** for the following reasons:

1. **Reliability**: Established service with good uptime
2. **Features**: Supports all major Midjourney operations
3. **Compliance**: Less risk than Discord automation
4. **Integration**: Clean REST API fits our architecture

## Implementation Plan

1. Create MidjourneyProvider class
2. Handle asynchronous generation (webhook or polling)
3. Parse Midjourney parameters and seeds
4. Map our generation requests to Midjourney format
5. Handle rate limiting and quotas

## Challenges

1. **Asynchronous Nature**: Midjourney takes 30-60 seconds
2. **Parameter Parsing**: Complex prompt syntax
3. **Cost**: More expensive than direct APIs
4. **Reliability**: Depends on third-party service

## Alternative: Flux Models

Given the challenges, we might also want to support FLUX models (which we already have via fal.ai) as a Midjourney alternative for users who want similar quality without the integration complexity.
