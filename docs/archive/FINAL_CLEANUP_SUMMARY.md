## Code Cleanup

### Completed
1. ✅ Removed _v2 suffixes from event files
2. ✅ Renamed generic file names to be descriptive
3. ✅ Added deprecation warnings to old cache systems
4. ✅ Created simple quickstart example
5. ✅ Organized examples into quickstart + advanced
6. ✅ Added clear tagline throughout codebase

### Migration Scripts
The following one-time migration scripts remain in scripts/:
- `cleanup_empty_metadata.py` - Removes empty metadata files
- `cleanup_root.py` - Cleans root directory
- `fix_imports.py` - Fixed imports after module moves
- `migrate_metadata.py` - Migrates old metadata format
- `remove_old_metadata.py` - Removes outdated metadata

These scripts are kept for users who may need to migrate from older versions.

## Project Structure

The project now has a clear structure:
- Clear identity as "AI Media Organizer"
- Organized documentation in logical locations
- Deprecated code marked for future removal
- Migration paths documented
- Clean, descriptive file names throughout

## Next Steps

For v3.0:
1. Remove deprecated cache implementations
2. Consolidate organizer classes
3. Reorganize interface module structure
4. Remove one-time migration scripts

The codebase is now clean, well-organized, and ready for continued development.
