# Documentation Update Summary

This document summarizes all documentation updates made to reflect the current AliceMultiverse implementation.

## Files Created

### API_KEYS.md
- Created comprehensive API key management documentation
- Covers macOS Keychain storage, environment variables, and command-line options
- Includes setup instructions for SightEngine and Anthropic Claude
- Added security best practices and troubleshooting guide

## Files Updated

### README.md
1. **Supported Formats**: Added WebP and HEIC/HEIF to supported image formats
2. **Caching System**: Updated to reflect unified content-addressed caching with metadata storage in source folders
3. **Database Integration**: Mentioned optional database support for advanced features

### CLAUDE.md
1. **Key Modules**: Updated to reference UnifiedCache class instead of generic metadata caching
2. **Architecture**: Added supported formats with metadata embedding note
3. **API Key Setup**: Simplified to reference `alice keys setup` and environment variables
4. **Database Setup**: Marked as optional feature
5. **Pipeline Documentation**: Added configurable scoring weights and updated folder structure

### README_DATABASE.md
1. **Content-Addressed Storage**: Added WebP and HEIC/HEIF format support note
2. **Usage Example**: Updated import paths to reflect actual module structure
3. **Advanced Features**: Added sections on UnifiedCache integration, asset discovery, and semantic search

### docs/architecture/caching-strategy.md
1. **Cache System**: Updated diagram to show UnifiedCache components
2. **Storage Location**: Changed from `.alicemultiverse_cache/` to `.metadata/`
3. **Architecture**: Reflects unified caching system consolidation

### docs/getting-started/configuration.md
1. **Cache Directory**: Updated from `cache_dir: ".alicemultiverse_cache"` to `metadata_dir: ".metadata"`

### docs/developer/implementation-notes.md
1. **MediaOrganizer**: Added WebP/HEIC support and UnifiedCache reference
2. **Keys CLI**: Updated path and added setup wizard, Keychain integration notes
3. **Unified Cache**: Replaced metadata cache section with unified cache details

### docs/developer/development.md
1. **Project Structure**: Completely updated to reflect current modular architecture
2. Added all new modules: unified_cache, config_dataclass, pipeline_stages, etc.
3. Included database, assets, and interface packages

## Key Changes Documented

1. **Unified Cache System**: The new UnifiedCache class consolidates all caching functionality
2. **Dataclass Configuration**: Simplified configuration using dataclasses instead of OmegaConf
3. **Content-Addressed Storage**: Emphasized throughout as core architecture principle
4. **WebP/HEIC Support**: Added to all relevant format lists
5. **Pipeline Architecture**: Updated to show configurable scoring weights and simplified folder structure
6. **API Key Management**: Streamlined with focus on `alice keys setup` wizard
7. **Module Structure**: Reflects actual implementation with proper import paths

## Consistent Themes

- All command examples use `alice` command instead of old script names
- Metadata stored in source `.metadata/` folders, not destination
- Content hashing (SHA256) enables file movement without metadata loss
- Database is optional for advanced features
- Progressive pipeline filtering reduces API costs
- macOS Keychain is primary secure storage method

This update ensures all documentation accurately reflects the current codebase implementation.
