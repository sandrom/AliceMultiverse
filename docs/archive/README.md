# Archived Documentation

This folder contains completed plans and deprecated documentation that we want to keep for historical reference but are no longer actively used.

## Completed Plans

- **REDIS_REMOVAL_PLAN.md** (Completed June 2025) - Successfully made Redis optional in favor of file-based events

## Why Archive?

These documents provide valuable context about past decisions and implementations. They're kept here to:
1. Understand why certain decisions were made
2. Reference successful migration strategies
3. Avoid repeating past work
