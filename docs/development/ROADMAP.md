# AliceMultiverse Roadmap

## Vision

AliceMultiverse is evolving from a media organization tool into a comprehensive creative workflow hub that bridges AI assistants with creative tools and APIs. Our goal is to support creative professionals who work iteratively with AI over extended periods, maintaining context and continuity across sessions.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ (Current)

**Status**: Completed foundations, actively implementing

- ✅ **Event-Driven Architecture** - Foundation for future microservices
- ✅ **Database Layer** - SQLAlchemy models with migration support
- ✅ **Alice Orchestration Interface** - Intelligent endpoint for AI assistants

### Phase 2: Integration 🚧 (Q1-Q2 2025)

**Focus**: Provider integrations and project management

- 🔲 **fal.ai Provider System**
  - Direct integration with FLUX, Kling, and other models
  - Cost optimization and failover handling
  - Unified provider abstraction

- 🔲 **Project Management**
  - Creative context preservation
  - Project-based asset organization
  - Long-term continuity support

- 🔲 **Workflow Engine**
  - Reusable creative workflows
  - Multi-step generation pipelines
  - Progress tracking and resumption

- ✅ **Enhanced Alice Interface**
  - Natural language asset search ✅
  - Context-aware responses ✅
  - Creative decision tracking ✅
  - Creative memory system ✅
  - Pattern recognition 🔄

### Phase 3: Music Video Production 🎬 (Q2-Q3 2025)

**Focus**: Specialized features for music video creation

- 🔲 **Audio Analysis**
  - Beat detection and tempo mapping
  - Mood analysis over time
  - Section detection (verse/chorus)

- 🔲 **Timeline Generation**
  - Frame-accurate synchronization
  - Multiple export formats (AAF, EDL, FCPXML)
  - Beat grid alignment

- 🔲 **Visual Generation**
  - Beat-synchronized image creation
  - Style consistency across scenes
  - Batch generation management

### Phase 4: Distribution 🌐 (Q3-Q4 2025)

**Focus**: Scaling and team collaboration

- 🔲 **Service Extraction**
  - Asset processing service
  - Workflow execution service
  - Project management service

- 🔲 **Dapr Integration**
  - Infrastructure abstraction
  - Pub/sub communication
  - State management

- 🔲 **Team Features**
  - Multi-user projects
  - Permission management
  - Collaborative workflows

### Phase 5: Scale & Polish 🚀 (2026)

**Focus**: Production readiness and optimization

- 🔲 **Performance Optimization**
  - GPU resource pooling
  - Intelligent caching layers
  - Batch processing optimization

- 🔲 **Advanced Integrations**
  - ComfyUI workflows
  - DaVinci Resolve plugins
  - Real-time collaboration

- 🔲 **Enterprise Features**
  - Cloud deployment options
  - Audit trails
  - SLA guarantees

## Current Priorities

1. **Alice Orchestration Layer** - Building the intelligent interface for AI assistants
2. **fal.ai Integration** - Priority provider for image/video generation
3. **Event System Maturity** - Expanding event coverage and monitoring

## Design Principles

- **Creative Chaos**: Support how creative minds actually work
- **Local-First**: User data sovereignty with optional cloud
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase delivers working software
- **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling for organic evolution

## How to Contribute

1. **Check Current Phase** - Focus on active phase items
2. **Review Events** - New features should publish/subscribe to events
3. **Follow Architecture** - Maintain separation of concerns
4. **Test Everything** - Comprehensive test coverage required

## Metrics for Success

- **Phase 1**: 100% of operations publish events
- **Phase 2**: AI can resume projects after 3+ months
- **Phase 3**: Frame-accurate beat synchronization
- **Phase 4**: <100ms inter-service communication
- **Phase 5**: 99.9% uptime for production deployments
