## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (2025-01-06) - Part 2
- **Understanding System Integration**: Fixed multiple issues preventing AI analysis
  - API keys now loaded from keychain automatically via APIKeyManager
  - Fixed ImageAnalysisResult attribute errors (positive_prompt â†’ generated_prompt, removed timestamp/processing_time)
  - Fixed JSON serialization of MediaType enums with custom encoder
  - Fixed MetadataCacheAdapter missing enable_understanding attribute
  - Fixed ProcessingConfig.get() error (using dataclass attribute access)
  - Fixed quality_stars KeyError in statistics update
- **Import Issues**: Fixed scoped import conflict in main_cli.py causing UnboundLocalError
- **Understanding Provider**: Defaults to 'anthropic' when API key is available
- **Perceptual Hashing Integration**: Fixed perceptual hash computation
  - Fixed missing content_hash in AnalysisResult causing database constraint error
  - Fixed MediaType enum comparison in search index update
  - Perceptual hashes (pHash, dHash, aHash) now computed and stored during organization
  - Added proper error handling and logging for hash computation

### Fixed (2025-01-06)
- **Removed Hardcoded Paths**: Fixed all hardcoded test_data/ references
  - FileProjectService now uses config.storage.project_paths
  - SearchHandler uses config.storage.search_db
  - Comparison system uses config.paths.organized
  - All paths now configurable via settings.yaml
  - Added test_path_configuration.py to verify fixes
- **Production Ready**: System can now be deployed with custom paths

### Added (2025-01-06)
- **Understanding Integration**: Connected AI understanding to caching and search
  - UnifiedCache runs understanding analysis when enabled
  - Tags stored in v4.0 cache format with structured categories
  - Search index builder extracts semantic tags from cache
  - DuckDB search supports tag-based queries and facets
  - Understanding enabled by default in settings
  - Provider selection configurable (deepseek default for cost)
- **Lazy Loading**: Fixed circular imports with lazy module loading
- **Auto-indexing**: Files automatically indexed in DuckDB during organization
  - Metadata and tags indexed when files are processed
  - Understanding data flows through to search index
- **Exclusion Lists**: Scanner skips 'sorted-out' folders
  - Prevents re-processing of rejected files
  - Supports 'sorted-out' and 'sorted_out' variants
  - Also excludes .metadata and .alice folders
- **Similarity Search**: Implemented perceptual hashing
  - Three hash types: pHash (DCT), dHash (difference), aHash (average)
  - Hamming distance calculation for similarity matching
  - DuckDB table and indexes for perceptual hashes
  - find_similar_by_phash method with configurable threshold
  - Automatic hash calculation during organization and indexing

### Breaking Changes (2025-06-01)
- **Removed PostgreSQL Integration**: Complete removal of PostgreSQL dependency
  - Deleted alembic/ directory and all migrations
  - Removed SQLAlchemy models and repository classes
  - Updated all modules to work without database
  - Search functionality temporarily disabled (will use DuckDB)
  - Project management temporarily non-functional
  - Asset discovery limited to filesystem operations
- **Simplified Deployment**: No database server required
