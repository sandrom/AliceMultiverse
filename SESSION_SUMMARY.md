# Session Summary - June 3, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Progress Tracking for Multi-Path Storage ✅
- Added `tqdm` progress bars to file scanning and discovery operations
- Implemented progress callbacks for external monitoring
- Added `--no-progress` flag to CLI commands
- Created `consolidate` command for project asset consolidation
- Demo script: `examples/advanced/storage_progress_demo.py`

### 2. Cloud Storage Support (S3 and GCS) ✅
- Implemented `S3Scanner` for Amazon S3 buckets
  - Supports authentication via config or environment
  - Upload/download functionality
  - Content hash calculation
- Implemented `GCSScanner` for Google Cloud Storage
  - Supports service account credentials
  - Upload/download functionality
  - Blob management
- Integrated cloud scanners with `MultiPathScanner`
- Added cloud file transfer support in `_transfer_file`
- Example configuration: `examples/cloud_storage_config.yaml`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_cloud_scanners.py`

### 3. Auto-Migration System ✅
- Created `AutoMigrationService` for rule-based file movement
  - Analyzes files against storage location rules
  - Supports copy and move operations
  - Concurrent transfers with semaphore control
- Implemented `MigrationScheduler` for periodic runs
  - Configurable interval (default: 24 hours)
  - Background task management
- Added CLI command: `alice storage migrate`
  - Dry-run support for preview
  - Progress tracking
  - Detailed migration reporting
- Demo script: `examples/advanced/auto_migration_demo.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_auto_migration.py`

## Next Steps

### Remaining Multi-Path Storage Tasks
1. **Sync Tracking** - Handle conflicts and versioning
   - Track sync status between locations
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Version management for changed files

### Video Creation Workflow (Next Sprint)
- Already implemented MCP tools
- Need to integrate with main workflow
- Create comprehensive examples

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `alicemultiverse/storage/cloud_scanners.py`
- `alicemultiverse/storage/auto_migration.py`
- `examples/advanced/storage_progress_demo.py`
- `examples/cloud_storage_config.yaml`
- `examples/advanced/auto_migration_demo.py`
- `tests/unit/test_cloud_scanners.py`
- `tests/unit/test_auto_migration.py`

### Modified Files
- `alicemultiverse/storage/multi_path_scanner.py` - Added progress tracking and cloud support
- `alicemultiverse/storage/cli.py` - Added `consolidate` and `migrate` commands
- `alicemultiverse/storage/location_registry.py` - Added `update_scan_time` method
- `ROADMAP.md` - Updated progress on multi-path storage features

## Commits Made
1. "feat: Add progress tracking to multi-path storage operations"
2. "feat: Add cloud storage support (S3 and GCS)"
3. "feat: Add auto-migration system for rule-based file movement"

## Technical Notes
- Progress tracking uses `tqdm` library
- Cloud storage requires optional dependencies:
  - S3: `boto3`
  - GCS: `google-cloud-storage`
- Auto-migration uses file modification times for age calculation in tests
- DuckDB foreign key constraints don't support CASCADE operations
